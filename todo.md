# todo: openpos

Started 2026-09-06. Boxes are ticked only after the work is done and evidenced.

## Design
- [x] Decide product shape: ground-up build, open core on the Postiz model (AGPL, free self-host, paid cloud)
- [x] Decide runtime: portable Node + Postgres, Cloudflare in front, not Cloudflare-native
- [x] Decide v1 scope: till, sync + tenancy, catalogue + stock + purchasing, cash + shifts + roles
- [x] Adversarial architecture review (two independent reviews, both archived)
- [x] Revise design: leased receipt numbers, no gapless promise in v1, Vite not Next for the till,
      terminal-scoped shifts, stock-count barriers, Capacitor Android shell
- [x] Write `docs/06092026_openpos_feature_spec.md`
- [x] Write `docs/c4model.md`
- [x] Re-review tech from first principles with measured evidence (`bench/`)
- [x] Revise to a Rust core with thin per-platform UIs, Flutter on Android, Axum server
- [ ] User reviews the spec

## Implementation
- [x] Cargo workspace, `openpos-core` crate, strict lints (no unsafe, no unwrap, no raw arithmetic)
- [x] `core::money`: integer Minor, Milli, Bp with checked arithmetic and half-away-from-zero rounding
- [x] `core::domain::pricing`: line totals, VAT inclusive and exclusive, discounts, ticket discount
      apportionment without drift, change due
- [x] Property tests: 7 properties, 22 tests green, clippy clean under the strict lint set
- [x] `core::ids`: ULID as u128, Crockford base32, injected clock and entropy
- [x] `core::replica`: in-memory catalogue, barcode, code and sorted token indices, delta batches,
      live on-hand. Measured 9 ns per barcode lookup, 46.8 ms to build 20k items, 4.7 MB heap
- [x] `core::cart`: sale state machine both UIs drive. Line merging, frozen prices, discount
      ceilings with supervisor override, split tenders, close into an immutable ticket
- [x] `core::lease`: server-leased receipt blocks, epoch fencing, reserve block, unnumbered sales
- [x] Storage design reviewed adversarially: five-op trait rejected, IndexedDB dropped, Web Worker
      plus OPFS, transactional commit, two stores, protocol in the core
- [x] `core::storage::frame`: envelope, CRC-32, torn-write recovery, owner check
- [x] `core::storage::backend`: six-operation contract, in-memory backend, fault-injecting backend
      that fails, tears and cuts power at any chosen operation
- [x] `core::storage::journal`: durable commit with rollback, torn-tail repair on open, A/B snapshot
      slots, checkpoint ordering, independent store lifecycles
- [x] Recovery property tests: acknowledged sales always survive, unacknowledged ones never appear,
      a completed snapshot always loads, the journal always reopens
- [x] `core::storage::wire`: postcard types mirroring the domain, schema dispatch, validation on
      decode. Cold start measured end to end: 1.9 MB on disk, 35.2 ms to a sellable indexed catalogue
- [x] `core::sync`: pull persisted before applied, cursor advanced only when durable, cold-start
      recovery from snapshot plus log replay, checkpoint policy threshold
- [x] `core::sync::outbox`: pending derived from the ledger rather than kept beside it,
      acknowledgement as a durable watermark, log emptied only when nothing is outstanding
- [x] `core::till`: the facade the FFI and both UIs call. Cold start, scan, cart, checkout with
      lease rollback on failure, sync, checkpoint, status
- [x] `core::protocol`: network types with explicit version negotiation, kept separate from the
      disk format so a wire change cannot force a disk migration
- [x] `openpos-server` ingest: idempotent by ULID, revalidates totals with the shared crate,
      quarantines rather than rejects, tenant-scoped repository trait with an in-memory impl
- [x] Server HTTP surface: Axum router, postcard bodies, push, pull with paging, lease issue,
      health, graceful shutdown. Binary runs and answers
- [x] Repository trait made asynchronous and shared-reference, so Postgres fits behind it and no
      lock sits around the whole server
- [x] Postgres repository: migrations, uuid identity, per-tenant catalogue cursor, lease blocks
      allocated in one statement, row-level security with FORCE and both USING and WITH CHECK
- [x] Verified live: 8 database tests against real Postgres as a non-superuser role, and two lease
      requests over HTTP returning non-overlapping blocks 1-500 and 501-1000
- [x] Terminal authentication: bearer tokens issued at enrolment, SHA-256 hashes stored, identity
      taken from the credential rather than the request body
- [x] Back office endpoints: repair queue, terminal health, catalogue editing. Authenticated with a
      terminal credential, because no owner role exists yet: any enrolled device in a shop can read
      that shop's queue and edit its prices. Documented, not papered over
- [x] Enrolment flow: short single-use codes with a short expiry, typo tolerant, traded for a real
      token over the wire. Revocation of one credential or of every credential a terminal holds
- [x] Rate limiting on enrolment: fixed window per client address, keyed from the connection rather
      than a spoofable header, body size capped. Verified live: ten attempts allowed, eleventh 429
- [x] Tenant export and import, needed for self-host to cloud and back. JSON Lines, keyset paged,
      idempotent, catalogue sequences preserved rather than renumbered so a till's cursor still means
      something. Not a point-in-time snapshot, and said so rather than implied otherwise
- [x] End-to-end tests: a real Till against the real HTTP server. A shop's day offline then
      syncing, a replay after a dropped reply, a cold start mid-day, and a price change that does
      not reprice an open basket
- [x] `core::shift`: terminal-scoped drawer, cash in and out with a mandatory reason, X and Z
      reports with the declared-against-expected variance
- [x] Hold and resume: the parked set written whole to standing state, restored verbatim rather than
      repriced, refused while a basket is already on screen
- [x] Refunds as the exact mirror of a sale: negated quantities, exact-balance close, the reversed
      receipt carried on the commit
- [x] Adversarial review of the whole implementation, and the fixes it produced (see below)
- [ ] `flutter_rust_bridge` spike (gate on the Flutter till)

## From the adversarial review (2026-09-06)
Every fix below has a test that fails without it.
- [x] Critical: a fully drained outbox emptied the critical log and took the terminal's leased
      receipt numbers and parked baskets with it, so a shop that synced last night opened this
      morning, offline, with nothing. Standing state moved to its own A/B blob slot
- [x] Critical: recovery advanced only the active lease block, so a till that crossed a block
      boundary offline and rebooted reissued numbers already printed on receipts
- [x] High: VAT was computed before a ticket discount and never after it, overcharging the customer
      and over-declaring the tax on every ticket-discounted sale
- [x] High: the catalogue's id index was rebuilt only after a whole batch, so within a batch it lied:
      tombstones lost, items duplicated, price updates silently dropped
- [x] High: one item on two lines emitted two stock movements keyed alike, and the server discarded
      the second, so the ledger permanently undercounted what left the shop
- [x] High: the server's totals recheck read every recompute failure as agreement, so breaking the
      arithmetic bypassed the tamper check
- [x] set_qty accepted a negative quantity on a sale, which turned change due into a payout: a refund
      with no permission, no original receipt and nothing calling it a refund
- [x] Negative prices refused in the arithmetic, in the override, and at the wire boundary
- [x] `check_owner` existed to catch a cloned tablet and was called by nothing
- [x] A rollback that itself fails now poisons the journal rather than leaving a frame that the next
      commit flushes as a second sale for one basket
- [x] Bytes recovery cannot read are copied aside before truncation, instead of being destroyed at
      the one moment a person could still have recovered them
- [x] Journal sequences no longer restart at one after the log is emptied
- [x] `FaultyBackend` takes a schedule of faults, so double-fault interleavings are reachable
- [x] Duplicate lease grants ignored; unnumbered sales counted from the log so the count survives a
      reboot; `frame::encode` refuses an oversized payload instead of writing a wrong length
- [x] A catalogue pull no longer undoes stock this till has sold but not yet synced, so the count
      stops jumping back up while the cashier is looking at it
- [x] Enrolment rate limiting no longer collapses to one bucket behind a proxy. `X-Forwarded-For` is
      read only when the operator states how many proxies sit in front, counting from the right, and
      the budget is spent after the body parses so an unparseable flood cannot deny enrolment
- [x] Duplicate receipt detection had a TOCTOU window between check and store. A `receipt_claim`
      table makes the primary key decide it, inside the same transaction as the write, proved by two
      real connections racing against Postgres
- [x] `catalogue_change.payload` is versioned like every other stored payload, and a row this build
      cannot read is skipped and counted rather than failing the page, which used to turn one bad row
      into a permanent 503 for every till in the shop
- [x] Ingest is one round trip and one transaction per sale, down from three with two race windows
      between them. A per-batch transaction remains possible later; the window that mattered is shut
- [x] `SaleCommitV1.stock` is no longer trusted: the server recomputes movements from the ticket
      lines, so a self-consistent ticket can no longer decrement an item it never sold
- [x] No supervisor PIN anywhere in the core: the permission model was "the UI promises". `core::auth`
      now holds PBKDF2 credentials on the device, throttles guesses, derives the cart's ceilings from
      whoever signed in, and writes down who authorised each privileged action
- [x] Terminal tokens expire after a year and record when they were last presented, both stamped in
      the same statement that authenticates. Existing tokens keep working: expiring every live
      terminal at deploy time would take every till offline at once

- [x] Stock counts as ledger barriers: a count asserts what the shelf held at a moment and supersedes
      everything before it, on-hand is the count plus what moved after, and a sale rung before the
      count but arriving after it is excluded and raised rather than guessed at either way

- [x] Purchasing: suppliers, goods receipts with per-delivery unit cost, and the movement ledger
      generalised so a receipt is a movement like a sale. Idempotent on the receipt id, because stock
      booked twice is a shop ordering against goods it does not have
- [x] The movement ledger carries its own occurrence and arrival times, so a barrier can place a
      movement without knowing what kind of thing caused it, and on-hand needs no join

- [x] Verified the core actually compiles to wasm32, which the whole design rests on and nothing had
      ever tested. Real artifact measured: 83.6 KB gzipped against a 400 KB budget
- [x] `openpos-bindings`: the till facade as one WASM module, JSON in and JSON out, holding no rules
      of its own. Errors come back inside the view so a UI cannot silently drop one
- [x] Every public error type now carries a message a shopkeeper could act on, which the facade needs
      and which nothing else was providing

- [x] Found only by running it in a browser: `i64` parameters cross to JavaScript as BigInt, so
      `scan(code, 2000)` threw a TypeError about BigInt conversion before reaching any till code.
      The boundary now takes JavaScript numbers and refuses any that is not exactly a whole number,
      because `as i64` would have truncated 12.7 to 12 and the shop would find out at the end of day

- [x] Found in Chrome, and only findable there: an OPFS handle carries an implicit position that a
      write advances, so a read issued after a write starts where that write ended and returns
      nothing. A blob written and read back in the same breath came back empty. Left alone, a till
      would have booted on an empty ledger rather than refusing to boot at all, which is the worst
      shape this failure could take. Every read now states its offset

## Open, and named rather than left implied
- [x] Token renewal: `/v1/renew` trades a working credential for a fresh one, authenticated with the
      one being replaced. The old one lapses after a day rather than being revoked, because the reply
      can be lost and a till whose only credential vanished mid-request is a shop offline until
      somebody re-enrols the tablet by hand. Renewing never extends a deadline
- [ ] Per-batch ingest transaction. One per sale now, down from three; the race window is shut, the
      latency of a full-day drain over mobile data is not yet measured
- [ ] An export is not a point-in-time snapshot: each page is its own transaction, so a till syncing
      mid-export can be missed. Idempotent import is what makes it safe, and re-running converges
- [x] OPFS backend written and proved in Chrome: a sale rung in a worker survives that worker being
      destroyed, and a brand new till reads it back from disk. Cold-start-offline, demonstrated
- [x] A storage self-test the platform can run at boot, kept rather than deleted once it worked: the
      difference between "this browser will not flush" and "this ledger is corrupt" decides whether
      somebody restores a backup or buys a different tablet
- [x] The module has been loaded and run by a real browser. `wasm-pack` installed, glue generated,
      page served, sale rung in Chrome: net 860.00, VAT 129.00, total 989.00, change 11.00, matching
      the native suite exactly. 74.3 KB gzipped whole, 5.1 ms to instantiate, 0.300 ms per scan
- [x] Manual stock corrections: breakage, spoilage, theft, a sample given away, a count that was
      wrong. Movement kind 3, owner only, a reason required by the schema and refused when blank,
      idempotent on the correction id, and superseded by a later count like any other movement
- [x] Back office routes now need an owner credential. A till may ring sales and sync and nothing
      else, so a tablet left on a counter is no longer the whole shop. Existing credentials became
      owners in the migration, because that is what they demonstrably were

- [x] Enrolling a second device is a workflow: an owner asks for a code naming a new terminal and a
      role, the server creates the terminal before the code exists, and the new tablet redeems it for
      a credential of that role. A caller may not grant a role above its own, and a code cannot be
      left standing longer than an hour

## Next
- [ ] Implementation plan document, once more of the core shape is proven in code
- [ ] Spike `flutter_rust_bridge` before committing the Flutter till
- [ ] Resolve open questions: NBR primary source, printer models to certify, Android distribution,
      DCO before first external PR, hosting substrate for the paid tier, browser storage backend
